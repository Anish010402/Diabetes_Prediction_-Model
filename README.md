# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
This repository contains a Diabetes Prediction Model built using Python and machine learning algorithms to classify whether a patient has diabetes based on medical attributes. The project compares Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes classifiers to determine the more effective approach.

📌 Project Overview
Developed a supervised learning model for predicting diabetes.
Implemented Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes classifiers.
Evaluated model performance based on accuracy and generalization ability.
Naïve Bayes achieved 72.36% accuracy, while Decision Tree scored 71.28%.
Naïve Bayes was found to be the slightly better model due to its balanced performance, but Decision Tree remains competitive for interpretability and class-specific optimization.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the model:
Python (Core programming language)
Pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
Matplotlib (Data visualization)
Seaborn (Statistical data visualization)
Missingno (Handling and visualizing missing data)
Scikit-Learn (Machine learning model implementation)
Graphviz (Visualizing Decision Tree structures)

📊 Model Performance Comparison
Model	Accuracy (%)	Key Advantage
Decision Tree	71.28%	More interpretable, better for feature importance analysis
Naïve Bayes	72.36%	Slightly higher accuracy, better generalization

🚀 Future Enhancements
Implement hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance.
Explore other machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) for better accuracy.
Optimize feature selection for better prediction reliability.
